# MIDAS-Task3-Summer-Internship-2021
Welcome to the Task3 submission by Neel Bhandari

I have 4 specific tasks that I have focussed on :
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Exploration and Visualisation
3. Model development for category prediction
4. Future work

The notebook focusses on all 4 parts.
The models I have used include:
On TF-IDF:
  1. Naive Bayes
  2. KNearest Neighbours Classifier
  3. Random Forest
  4. SVM
  5. Logistic Regression
  6. Stacked Classifier: Could not implement yet.

On Embeddings:
  1. LSTM

For each model, I have provided a detailed intuition behind my use of it, an interpretation of the results based on research and why I compared it with other models.
